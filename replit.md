## Data Flow

### Scan Workflow
1. User creates scan configuration through web interface
2. Scan request validated and queued
3. Scanner service executes appropriate scanning tools
4. Results processed and stored in database
5. AI service analyzes findings for enhanced insights
6. Vulnerabilities extracted and categorized
7. Alerts generated for critical findings
8. Email notifications sent to relevant users

### Authentication Flow
1. User submits credentials
2. Password verified against hashed storage
3. JWT token generated and returned
4. Subsequent requests authenticated via token
5. Role-based access control applied

### AI Analysis Flow
1. Vulnerability data submitted to AI service
2. Multiple AI providers queried for analysis
3. Results aggregated and confidence scored
4. Enhanced insights returned to user
5. Recommendations generated for remediation
